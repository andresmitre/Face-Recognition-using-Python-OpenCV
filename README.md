# Face Recognition using Python & OpenCV
Simple Face Recognition algorithm using Haar Cascade Classifer & Local Binary Pattern Histograms(LBPH)

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- OpenCV 3.2.0
- Numpy

## Outline
This project consist of 3 parts, which are:
1. Creating datasets
2. Train the model 
3. Face Recognition

## How to run?
- Run faceRecognition.py
- To create dataset, when face detected press "c" to capture face, and then enter name of the person. A folder will be created in dataset.
- The images get trained by itself and the results will be shown if no interupption is made while camera is live.
